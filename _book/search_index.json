[["index.html", "Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey Codebook Preface", " Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey Codebook Development and Policies Research Center (DEPOCEN) 2026-01-10 Preface The Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) is one of the most comprehensive and widely used micro-datasets for socio-economic research in Viet Nam. However, as the survey has evolved significantly since its inception in 1993 through changes in sampling design, questionnaire structure, and variable naming, longitudinal analysis requires rigorous data cleaning and harmonization. Through our work with this dataset, we noticed that while many researchers have cleaned and used the VHLSS, most work in isolation. This leads to inconsistent cleaning procedures and a narrow focus on specific modules. We encountered this same fragmentation even within our own team, and it is a challenge shared by the broader research community. Thus, this documentation was developed by the Development and Policies Research Center (DEPOCEN) to serve as a standardized guide for researchers and data analysts. Our goal is to ensure that the data cleaning process is: Reproducible: All steps are scripted to ensure consistency. Transparent: Every decision regarding outliers, missing values, and variable merging is documented. Accessible: By centralizing metadata and harmonization crosswalks, we aim to reduce the “entry barrier” for new researchers using VHLSS. Who are we? This codebook was developed by a research team at DEPOCEN, comprising Tuong-Vy Phan, Huy Le Vu, and Nguyen Thi Hong Tram, under the supervision of Dr. Anh Ngoc Nguyen. We would like to express their gratitude to Dr. Doan Quang Hung for providing the core variable list and to Dr. Vu Hoang Linh for sharing the data-cleaning scripts for the consumption module. We are grateful for the comments and support of other DEPOCEN researchers, including Manh-Duc Doan, Quang-Thanh Tran, Nguyen Viet Lien, and Ha-My Bui. Who is this for? This guide is intended for economists, policy analysts, and students who are working with VHLSS microdata. We assume a basic understanding of statistical software (specifically Stata and R) and familiarity with household survey structures. Structure of the Documentation Data Structure: An overview of the VHLSS history and sample design. Cleaning Procedure: A step-by-step workflow for moving from raw files to a master harmonized dataset, with provided Stata code. Notes &amp; References: A collection of insights from the wider economic research community. Acknowledgements We would like to thank the General Statistics Office (GSO) for their work in conducting these surveys and the various scholars whose previous notes on VHLSS provided the foundation for this consolidated procedure.

The purpose of the VHLSS in order to systematically monitor and supervise the living standards of different population groups in Viet Nam; to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy; and to contribute to the evaluation of achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Vietnam’s socio-economic development goals. Availability From 2002 to 2010, this survey has been conducted regularly by the GSO every two years. From 2011 to 2022, VHLSS are conducted annually. However, the odd-numbered year surveys only collect data on demographics, employment and income. Survey period The survey was conducted in four periods in March, June, September and December. The period for collecting information in the locality is one month. The reference period of household income and expenditure was the last 12 months. Coverage of the survey Geographically, the survey covered the whole country. Scope of the survey included all selected enumeration areas and communes in 63 provinces and cities under central management.

For instance, the household systems from 2010 to 2018 were designed using the 2009 Census. However, since the 2020 VHLSS was based on the 2019 Census, it is not possible to create a panel linking VHLSS 2016-2018 with 2020. 2.4 Weight Data At household level, each VHLSS will have a weihgt data for each year. Usually we would use \\(wt9\\), which is the weight of 9,000 household. There are also \\(wt36\\) and \\(wt45\\) is for file with 36,000 or 45,000 household. At individual level, we need to take the weight divided by the number of family member. \\(\\text{Weight individual} = \\frac{\\text{Weight household}}{\\text{Houshold size}}\\) "],["data-processing-procedure.html", "Chapter 3 Data Processing Procedure 3.1 Folder organization 3.2 Clear all settings 3.3 Set Working Directory 3.4 Clean data for each year 3.5 Append individual dataset 3.6 Inconsistent province codes 3.7 Generate new variables", " Chapter 3 Data Processing Procedure Analyzing the VHLSS longitudinally presents challenges due to structural design changes, administrative adjustments, and varying module contents. This section outlines these inconsistencies and our strategies for data harmonization. For this version, we utilize the 9,000-household sample to construct a pooled individual-level dataset, focusing on a specific subset of variables. The following sections provide a step-by-step guide to navigating this documentation. 3.1 Folder organization The folder contains data, do file and other materials are organized as follows: Sub-folder Description Action 01_dofiles Code in Stata to clean the datasets Run master.do only to modify cleaning 02_data Raw dataset in Stata (.dta) format Do not modify 03_temp Temporary files Do not modify 04_clean Cleaned data in Stata (.dta) format Download and use 05_metadata Questionnaire and codebook Access questionnaire and codebook here After organizing folder, first thing we need to do is clear all settings and set working directory. 3.2 Clear all settings cap log close clear all clear matrix set more off eststo clear 3.3 Set Working Directory Replace username and path to your folder. if &quot;`c(username)&#39;&quot; == &quot;XXX&quot; { gl MyProject &quot;/Users/XXX/My Drive/DEPOCEN - VHLSS Data cleaning&quot; gl data &quot;$MyProject/02_data&quot; gl temp &quot;$MyProject/03_temp&quot; gl clean &quot;$MyProject/04_clean&quot; gl metadata &quot;$MyProject/05_metadata&quot; } 3.4 Clean data for each year Make sure each file is uniquely defined As each survey year consists of multiple section-specific files, we must ensure all observations are uniquely identified prior to merging. forval i = 14 (2) 18 { foreach m in Muc1A Muc2A Muc2X Muc3A Muc3C Muc4a { local filepath &quot;$data/vhlss_20`i&#39;/hh_9000/`m&#39;.dta&quot; capture confirm file &quot;`filepath&#39;&quot; if _rc == 0 { use &quot;`filepath&#39;&quot;, clear if _N &gt; 0 { duplicates drop tinh huyen xa diaban hoso matv, force tempfile uniq_`m&#39;_20`i&#39; save `uniq_`m&#39;_20`i&#39;&#39;, replace } } } } Merge individual file forval i = 14 (2) 18 { use `uniq_Muc1A_20`i&#39;&#39;, clear foreach m in Muc2A Muc2X Muc3A Muc3C Muc4a { capture merge 1:1 tinh huyen xa diaban hoso matv using `uniq_`m&#39;_20`i&#39;&#39; capture drop if _m == 2 capture drop _m } save &quot;$temp/individual_20`i&#39;.dta&quot;, replace } Extract variables from household file These variables do not appear in individual file, so we need to take them from household file. forval i = 14 (2) 18 { use &quot;$data/vhlss_20`i&#39;/hh_9000/Ho1.dta&quot;, clear keep tinh huyen xa diaban hoso ttnt dantoc tsnguoi // take area, ethnic and household size variable duplicates drop tinh huyen xa diaban hoso, force tempfile indiv1_`i&#39; save `indiv1_`i&#39;&#39; use &quot;$data/vhlss_20`i&#39;/hh_9000/Muc5a1.dta&quot;, clear keep tinh huyen xa diaban hoso m5a1ma m5a1c2a m5a1c2b m5a1c3a m5a1c3b // take food consumption variabls duplicates drop tinh huyen xa diaban hoso, force tempfile indiv2_`i&#39; save `indiv2_`i&#39;&#39; use &quot;$data/vhlss_20`i&#39;/hh_9000/Muc5a2.dta&quot;, clear keep tinh huyen xa diaban hoso m5a2ma m5a2c2a m5a2c2b // take food consumption variabls duplicates drop tinh huyen xa diaban hoso, force destring m5a2ma, replace tempfile indiv3_`i&#39; save `indiv3_`i&#39;&#39; use &quot;$temp/individual_20`i&#39;.dta&quot;, clear forval j = 1/3 { merge m:1 tinh huyen xa diaban hoso using `indiv`j&#39;_`i&#39;&#39; drop if _m == 2 drop _m } save &quot;$temp/individual_20`i&#39;.dta&quot;, replace } Label define all variables Due to the legacy GSO encoding used in the raw data, we converted the character sets into a readable format. Specifically, we extracted the correct value labels for all variables of interest into a separate do-file, which is then executed within the master script. forval i = 14 (2) 18 { use &quot;$temp/individual_20`i&#39;.dta&quot;, clear // Run the fixed labels do &quot;$temp/vhlss_labels_fixed.do&quot; // Automatically attach labels to variables with the same name foreach v of varlist _all { capture label values `v&#39; `v&#39; } save &quot;$temp/individual_20`i&#39;.dta&quot;, replace } 3.5 Append individual dataset Import the meta data Variable names and the ordering of questions frequently change between survey waves. For instance, the variable for education may be coded as m2ac2a in one year and m2xc2a in another. To facilitate analysis, we have compiled comprehensive metadata mapping variable names and labels for each year, which is available in the 05_metadata/VHLSS_codebook_9k_thanhvien - thanhvien.csv. This dataset is restricted to variables of interest. To add further variables, download the metadata and ensure all new variables are harmonized to account for naming inconsistencies across years. import delimited &quot;$metadata/VHLSS_codebook_9k_thanhvien - thanhvien.csv&quot;, varnames(1) encoding(UTF-8) clear Rename and label code local N = _N forval i = 2014 (2) 2018 { // Open file file open myfile using `&quot;$temp/label_in`i&#39;.do&quot;&#39;, write text replace local renamed_vars &quot;&quot; forval iii = 1/`N&#39; { local vvvcode = code[`iii&#39;] local vvv_i = code_`i&#39;[`iii&#39;] local v_desc = description[`iii&#39;] // Check if code_`i&#39; is not empty if `&quot;`vvv_i&#39;&quot;&#39; != &quot;&quot; { // 1.

In most cases the changing of provincial boundaries was either a splitting or aggregating of existing provinces as opposed to districts being reallocated between provinces. The province codes also change within surveys and across data sources. All province codes in this processed dataset are consistent across years. The implementation of this standardization can be found in Brian McCaig’s website. 3.7 Generate new variables Below are variables of interest that we create for our research purpose Education gen
